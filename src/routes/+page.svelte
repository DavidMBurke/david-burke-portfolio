<p>I am a 6-4 student in my first semester at MIT. I transfered from Tidewater 
    Community College in Virginia where I earned 2 associate degrees in Computer Science
    and Engineering. Prior to this I spent 10 years in the Navy as a Submarine Nuclear
    Electrical Engineering Technician and as an instructor. I have a wife and a 3-year-old
    son.
